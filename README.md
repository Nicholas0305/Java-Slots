# phase-1-project
This application allows the user to have a simuluated slot machine experience, just as you would in a physical Casino.

Our project will be utilzing a json server file of our own fabrication, providing the image sources and attributes for the application.

The user will be able to enter the amount of money they would like to submit into the slot application, and then press the activation button to test their luck. If the slots have three of the same image in a row, the user will win a sum of money, which will be added to their account.

User Expectations/Deliverables:
1. Enter amount of money to play with
2. Press the activation button to run the slots application
3. Recieve a sum of money if the user gets three of the same images in a row.

Stretch Goals:
1. Display a list of different jackpots
2. We'll offer set amounts of free money, but if they lose they can't play again
3. Jackpot animation
